# 🍽️ Food Delivery System - C++ DSA Project

This is a console-based **Food Delivery System** developed as a course project for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** at the **International Islamic University, Islamabad (BSSE F23)**.

The project emphasizes the use of core DSA concepts including **custom data structures**, **sorting algorithms**, and **search mechanisms**, all implemented in **C++**.

## 📌 Features

- 📜 Menu Management using Binary Search Tree (BST)
- 📦 Order Processing with Priority Queue
- 💳 Secure Payment Validation
- 🔍 Order Search (Linear & Binary)
- 📊 Sorting Orders by Total Amount (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- 📝 File Serialization for Order History
- 🎨 Color-coded Console UI using `windows.h`

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

| Structure        | Purpose                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| `BST<MenuItem*>` | To maintain and display a sorted menu |
| `OrderQueue`     | Custom Priority Queue for processing orders |
| `unordered_map`  | Order history lookup by Order ID   |
| `map<string, MenuItem*>` | Fast item lookup during order placement |
